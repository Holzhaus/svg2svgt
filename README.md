Svg2SvgT
========

Library and tools to convert SVG images to SVG Tiny, the subset of SVG implemented by QtSvg.

This is a fork of the stale https://github.com/microsoft-mobile/svg-converter, with the following improvements:
* CMake used as build system
* Builds with Qt5
* Provides a shared library
* Conformance to FHS for easy packaging
